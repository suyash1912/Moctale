#  Moctale: A Classic Movie Recommender System

Moctale is a **Streamlit-based application** designed to recommend **classic movies released before the year 2000**.  
It offers multiple recommendation strategies, from simple content-based filtering to a sophisticated hybrid model that blends content similarity with movie popularity and ratings.

---

##  Features

- **Content-Based Filtering** â†’ Recommends movies based on similarity of genres, keywords, cast, and crew.  
- **ML Enhanced Reranking** â†’ Uses a trained Random Forest model to re-rank recommendations, prioritizing movies predicted to be more popular.  
- **Hybrid "Beast Mode"** â†’ Combines content similarity with weighted ratings and popularity for flexible discovery of *hidden gems* or *critically acclaimed* films.  
- **Customizable Recommendations** â†’ Adjust similarity, rating, and popularity weights to fine-tune results.  
- **Decade-Based Filtering** â†’ Narrow recommendations to specific decades.  
- **Multi-Seed Recommendations** â†’ Get suggestions based on multiple movies and custom keywords.

##  How It Works

The system runs on two main scripts:

- **`app.py`** â†’ Builds the Streamlit interface, handles data loading, feature processing, and runs different recommendation algorithms.  
  - Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** + **Cosine Similarity** for content-based matching.  
  - Integrates with the **TMDB API** to fetch posters.  

- **`model.py`** â†’ Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict movie popularity based on genres.  
  - Saves the trained model as `ml_model.pkl` (along with `mlb.pkl`).  
  - Used in `app.py` for ML-enhanced re-ranking.

## Data Source

This app uses datasets from **The Movie Database (TMDB)**:

- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`  
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`  

Both files must be in the same directory as the app scripts for proper functionality.
